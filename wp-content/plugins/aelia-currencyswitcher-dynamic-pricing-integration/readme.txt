Implements the integration between [Aelia Currency Switcher](https://aelia.co/shop/currency-switcher-woocommerce/) and [WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing plugin](https://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-dynamic-pricing/).

== Description ==
This plugin is a temporary workaround for the lack of multi-currency support in the Dynamic Pricing plugin. It acts as a bridge between [Aelia Currency Switcher](https://aelia.co/shop/currency-switcher-woocommerce/) and [WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing plugin](http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-dynamic-pricing/), ensuring that Dynamic Pricing prices are converted correctly into the currency being used to place an order.

* WordPress 4.7 or newer.
* WooCommerce 2.4.x to 2.7.x.
* Aelia Currency Switcher 4.4.6.170120 or newer.

* Free [Aelia Foundation Classes plugin for WooCommerce](http://aelia.co/downloads/wc-aelia-foundation-classes.zip) 1.8.3.170202 or newer.

== Installation ==
1. Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it! Now the price of the Dynamic Pricing you enter will be converted automatically in the appropriate currency.
